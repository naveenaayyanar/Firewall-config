 🔐 Things You Need to Know About Firewalls (Detailed Concepts)



 • Firewall (Definition & Purpose)

A firewall is a system (either software, hardware, or both) that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a defined set of security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the Internet.

Firewalls are used to:

* Prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network
* Allow legitimate communication based on port, protocol, IP, or application
* Log and alert suspicious activity

Types include:

* Packet-filtering firewalls
* Stateful inspection firewalls
* Proxy firewalls
* Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs)



 • Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls

# Stateful Firewall:

* Maintains a connection state table
* Remembers the state of active connections (e.g., TCP handshake)
* Makes decisions based on the context of the traffic
* More secure and intelligent
* Example: UFW, pfSense

Stateless Firewall:

* Treats each packet independently
* Doesn't retain knowledge of past traffic
* Faster but less secure
* Ideal for simple or performance-critical environments
* Example: Basic `iptables` rules without connection tracking



 • Inbound and Outbound Rules

* Inbound Rules: Define what kind of traffic is allowed into the system from external sources.

  * Example: Allowing HTTP traffic on port 80 or blocking Telnet on port 23.
* Outbound Rules: Define what traffic is allowed to leave the system and reach external networks.

  * Example: Restricting applications from sending data to the Internet.

These rules help enforce least privilege access by limiting communication to only what's necessary.



 • UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) and Its Benefits

UFW is a command-line interface for managing firewall rules in Linux, designed to be user-friendly. It is a frontend for `iptables`, and makes rule creation simpler and less error-prone.

# Key Benefits:

* Easy syntax:

  * `ufw enable`, `ufw allow 22`, `ufw deny 23`
* Pre-configured application profiles (e.g., OpenSSH)
* Supports logging and status display
* Great for beginners managing a Linux system

UFW abstracts complex `iptables` rules into readable and simple commands, improving usability and reducing misconfiguration risk.



 • Why Block Port 23 (Telnet)

Telnet operates on port 23 and is a legacy protocol used for remote logins. However, it:

* Sends data in plain text (including usernames and passwords)
* Is vulnerable to interception, spoofing, and MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks
* Lacks encryption and modern authentication methods

Because of these security flaws, Telnet is considered unsafe and is commonly blocked by firewalls. The recommended secure alternative is SSH (port 22), which uses encrypted sessions.



 • Common Firewall Mistakes

Some frequent errors that reduce firewall effectiveness include:

1. Allowing unnecessary ports or services to remain open (increasing attack surface)
2. Overly permissive rules such as "Allow All" traffic
3. Not updating rules after changes to network setup
4. Incorrect rule order or priority (in firewalls that evaluate rules sequentially)
5. Not monitoring firewall logs, missing signs of intrusion
6. Disabling firewall for troubleshooting and forgetting to re-enable it
7. Failing to apply rules across all network profiles (Domain, Private, Public)

Good firewall management requires regular audits, testing, and rule optimization.



 • How Firewalls Improve Network Security

Firewalls are foundational to any network security strategy. They:

* Control access to sensitive services and data
* Limit exposure by blocking unused ports and protocols
* Prevent spread of malware and lateral movement in networks
* Protect against external attacks, including DoS/DDoS (if configured)
* Enforce organizational policies on traffic flow and app access
* Hide internal IPs (when used with NAT or proxies)

Combined with intrusion detection systems (IDS) and antivirus, firewalls form the first line of defense.


NAT (Network Address Translation) in Firewalls

NAT is a technique used by routers and firewalls to translate private IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) into a public IP address when accessing the Internet.

Key Concepts:

* Conserves IPv4 addresses
* Hides internal network structure
* Adds an additional layer of security
* Common types: Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, and PAT (Port Address Translation)

In firewalls, NAT allows:

* Internal users to share a single public IP
* External access to internal services (via port forwarding)
* Masking of host identities from attackers
