 üîç How Firewalls Filter Traffic

A firewall acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks. It filters traffic based on:
- Inbound/Outbound rules
- IP addresses
- Ports and protocols
- Application-level permissions

 Example:
- Blocked TCP port 23 to prevent Telnet connections
- Allowed TCP port 22 to permit SSH access

This controls which services are reachable from outside and protects the system from unauthorized access.
