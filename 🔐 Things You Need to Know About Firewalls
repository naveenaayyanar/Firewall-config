-> A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It can be hardware, software, or both.

-> Stateful firewalls keep track of active connections and determine if packets are part of an existing flow. Stateless firewalls treat each packet independently, with no memory of previous packets.

-> Inbound rules manage traffic entering your system from external sources; outbound rules manage traffic leaving your system. Both are used to control access and secure communication.

-> UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a frontend for `iptables` on Linux. It simplifies firewall management with easy-to-use commands like `ufw allow 22` or `ufw deny 23`, removing the complexity of writing raw `iptables` rules.

-> Port 23 (Telnet) is often blocked because Telnet transmits data, including passwords, in plain text. It's insecure and vulnerable to interception. SSH (port 22) is the secure alternative.

-> Common firewall mistakes include leaving unnecessary ports open, using overly permissive rules, not updating rules after changes in services, and forgetting to test configurations.

-> A firewall improves network security by limiting access, preventing unauthorized communication, reducing attack surfaces, and enforcing policies like allowing only secure protocols.

-> NAT (Network Address Translation) in firewalls allows private internal IP addresses to be mapped to public IPs. It hides internal network structure and helps conserve public IPs, while also adding a layer of security.
